Design a network in CISCO packet tracer to connect ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments through the following: [40 points]
a. ﻿﻿﻿Each department should contain at least 2 PCs.
﻿﻿﻿b. Appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in the network.
c. ﻿﻿﻿Using the given network address 192.168.40.0, all interfaces should be configured with appropriate IP addresses, subnet mask and gateways.
d. ﻿﻿﻿All devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cables.
﻿﻿﻿e. Test the connectivity between ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY department -PCs in DELIVERY department should be able to ping the PCs in ACCOUNTS department.

Network address = 192.168.40.0

//number of subnets mean number of department
//in our case 2 departments, 2 subnets

No of subnets = 2

2^n = no of subnets , 2^n = 2

thus n = 1

255.255.255.255 ( 8 bits )

11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000 ( only 1 bit borrowed bc n = 1 ) ( binary )
255.255.255.128 ( block size (1) = 7 , 2^7 = 128 ) === subnet mask

1st subnet 
Subnet mask = 255.255.255.128
Network ID = 192.168.40.0
Range of valid host = 192.168.40.1-192.168.40.126
Broadcast ID = 192.168.40.127

2nd subnet 
Subnet mask = 255.255.255.128
Network ID = 192.168.40.128
Range of valid host = 192.168.40.129-192.168.40.254
Broadcast ID = 192.168.40.255
